            - Who were eligible for the airdrop?
            <br/>
            Any user who already had ETH at block 8113050 was eligible for 150 SHUF tokens for every ETH held at that time.
            <br/><br/>
            - Was there any cost? 
            <br/>
            The only cost of claiming SHUF tokens was the gas of the claim transaction. The tokens were distributed for free.
            <br/><br/>
            - Was there any minimum amount?
            <br/>
            No, you could claim for even one single wei.
            <br/><br/>
            - Was there a maximum amount?
            <br/>
            The maximum amount of tokens that a single address could claim was 1500 SHUF, equivalent to holding 10 ETH at block 8113050.
            <br/><br/>
            - How many SHUF tokens are there?
            <br/>
            The total amount of SHUF was one million and has already decreased. 
            <br/><br/>
            - What happened if too many tried to claim SHUF? 
            <br/>
            After all the 1,000,000 tokens were distributed, the airdrop stopped. 
            <br/><br/>
            - What is the Heap?
            <br/>
            The Heap is the data structure used to track the 512 top holders of the token; you may enter or leave the Heap depending on how much balance you have in relation to others.
            <br/><br/>
            - What happens if I am in the Heap?
            <br/>
            On every transaction made you may win 1% of the amount transferred.
            <br/><br/>
            - What is the SHUF transaction fee?
            <br/>
            Almost all transfers of SHUF tokens have a surcharge of 2%, half of the amount is burned, and the other half is sent to a winner drawn from the Heap.
            <br/><br/>
            - What is the burning of tokens?
            <br/>
            When tokens are burned, they are no longer part of the total emission of SHUF token, this adds to its scarcity and should increase the value of the remaining tokens.
            <br/><br/>
            - How is the random winner selected?
            <br/>
            The address of the sender is used as the seed of a random number generator, and from that unique generator, the index of the winner is obtained.
            <br/><br/>
            In this manner, we limit the ability of a sender to manipulate who is going to become the winner when they make a transfer.
            <br/><br/>
            - What goes to the developer?
            <br/>
            6% of the token emission, and we are subject to the same fees as every other user, also we don't have any means to emit or manipulate the circulating tokens.
            <br/><br/>
            - Is the project open source?
            <br/>
            Yes, you can find all the code in our Github repository.
            <br/>
            - What is USP of Shuffle?
            <br/>
            Heap-war create demand for Shuffle. Example - If Mr. A oust Mr. B out of Heap then Mr. B has to increas his Shuf Stack to join Heap back.
